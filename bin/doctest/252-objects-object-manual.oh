## #### Object
##
## Oh's `object` command is really just a convenience wrapper around a `block`
## command with an anonymous method that returns self as the final action.
##
## The previous example can be rewritten as,
##
#{
define o: object {
    export get $resolve

    export x 1
    define y 2
}

echo "public member" (o get x)
echo "private member" (o get y)
#}
##

#-     public member 1
#-     $'y not defined'
